# 🧰 Slider • James Chance — Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm **James “Slider” Chance**, a hands-on IT tech, builder, and Linux enthusiast.  
I combine old-school mechanical skills with modern open-source systems — custom PC builds, game consoles, and creative tech projects built from the ground up.
